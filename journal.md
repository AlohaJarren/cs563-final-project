## Journal Entry 1: Section Scaffolding and About Section

### Description of Work:

- Created the full `index.html` scaffold with all main sections: About, Previous Work, Projects, and Contact.
- Wrote and styled the `About` section using Bootstrap utilities for spacing and alignment.
- Inserted a headshot placeholder image for now, planning to replace with real one once uploaded.
- Added section anchors and Bootstrap classes to ensure responsive layout.
- Linked `styles.css` and `script.js` from `index.html`.
- Laid out `Previous Work` and `Projects` sections with semantic structure and placeholder content.
- Ensured that styles are modular and clear with proper HTML5 structure and consistent naming.

### Challenges:

- Making the one-page layout visually pleasing across all screen sizes took testing with Bootstrap classes.
- Deciding on semantic sectioning between About/Experience/Projects took a few iterations for balance.
- Opted for a simple `.container` structure with Bootstrap grid to manage layout responsiveness.

### Outside Sources Used:

- [Bootstrap 5 Documentation - Grid System](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/grid/)
- [MDN HTML Sectioning Elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/section)

### Next Steps:

- Flesh out Previous Work and Projects with full descriptions and links
- Begin styling each section independently using `styles.css`
- Start implementing interactivity in `script.js` (form validation, scroll animations, etc.)
